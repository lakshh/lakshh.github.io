<p>I attended the 5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course with Google. It was held online between 10th and 14th November. This
    course is most useful for software engineers, architects, and tech leads who want to explore and learn about Agents.
</p>

<p>Each day had four parts:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A summary podcast on the topic for the day. This was interesting because it was AI-generated. It was a good
        example of dogfooding.</li>
    <li>A whitepaper on the topic. Most papers were 50–70 pages.</li>
    <li>A few code assignments on Kaggle notebooks. These showed the topic in action and made it easier to understand.
    </li>
    <li>A livestream discussion led by experts from Google, NVIDIA, and Cohere.</li>
</ul>

<p>The course covered the following topics:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Introduction to Agents</li>
    <li>Tools and MCP</li>
    <li>Context Engineering</li>
    <li>Evaluation</li>
    <li>Observability</li>
    <li>Running Agents in Production</li>
    <li>Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol</li>
</ul>

<p>There was also a Discord server for all participants. We used it to discuss the topics and help each other with the
    assignments. I took part in these forums and answered both technical and conceptual questions. This helped me
    understand GenAI and Agents at a deeper level. It was also good to meet curious minds and share ideas.</p>

<p>The code assignments use Google’s Agent Development Kit (ADK). They also use the gemini-2.5-flash-lite model. This
    model stays in the free tier. It will not cost anything if you want to try the assignments. The course concludes
    with an assignment to create an AI agents project showcasing a use case that leverages some of the key capabilities
    learned throughout this course.</p>

<p>The course material will stay online. I am posting the links below to spread awareness.</p>

<p>Multi-Agent Systems will have a strong impact on how software systems evolve. This course has the right level of
    technical depth. It also has enough code examples to show how to build and run such systems in production.</p>

<p>Sharing this to help more people get started with Agents and learn more about them.</p>

    hardest challenge in building and running GenAI Agent systems.</p>
