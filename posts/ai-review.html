        A recent incident reinforced how I should approach working with AI tools.

    <p>
        I was working with a colleague to solve a file-reading issue, so I turned to an AI tool for help. I shared the
        code, the logs, and the expected behavior. The AI tool recommended a fix that resolved the issue on the first
        run.
    </p>
    <p>
        As we reviewed the code together, we considered how it would behave in different scenarios. During that
        analysis, we realized it could cause an out-of-memory error in an edge case.

        Always review the code generated by an AI tool, no matter how correct it appears or how much time the review
        takes.
        The AI tool does not account for every possible flow and usage pattern in a production environment.

        I asked the AI tool about the potential memory problem, and it acknowledged the issue. I then added instructions
        to the AI tool to always surface potential faults and
        trade-offs in its proposed code.

        You can improve AI output by adding relevant instructions that reflect your production scenarios and usage
        patterns.

        AI is a great accelerator, but it doesn't replace engineering skills and judgment. It’s our job to catch the
        the hidden issues the AI may not surface. AI tools deliver the best outcomes when we take the extra
        effort to guide and continually improve them.
