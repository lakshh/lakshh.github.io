<p>Sharing a few developments in the Agent-UI space that I’ve been tracking:</p>

<h2>Agent-Driven Interfaces (Generative UI)</h2>
<p>We are seeing a shift toward AI Chat interfaces that dynamically inject UI widgets such as forms, buttons, and
    pickers directly into conversation. Instead of a user typing complex instructions, the user interacts with a
    contextual UI element generated on the fly based on the conversation. This significantly improves usability for
    complex inputs.</p>
<p><strong>Frameworks to watch:</strong> A2UI (recently open-sourced by Google), OpenAI Apps SDK, and MCP Apps.</p>

<h2>The Agent–User Interaction (AG-UI) Protocol</h2>
<p>AG-UI is an open, event-based standard designed to connect agents to front-end applications. While MCP connects
    agents to tools, AG-UI connects agents to users. It supports real-time, multimodal interactions and interactive
    agent experiences.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 4px;"><strong>Technical note:</strong> It includes a React component library for easy
    integration into new or existing apps.</p>

<h2>OpenCode</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 4px;">An open-source coding agent that is model-agnostic (including local models). It operates
    across the terminal, desktop, and IDE. For developers, this provides a complete offline agentic coding workflow,
    maintaining data privacy while removing the costs associated with proprietary tools.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 40px; font-style: italic; color: var(--color-text-muted);">This marks an evolution of AI
    applications from being purely chat-based to providing rich, personalized interfaces of Apps that integrate
    seamlessly into the conversational flow.</p>
