    <p>
        One of the most important skills that you need to develop is to clearly document your contributions and
        accomplishments in the self appraisal document during a performance review.
        This is always considered a boring chore. But you can convert this into an opportunity to showcase your value,
        map your career trajectory and reflect on your growth opportunities.
        Let us look at some of the key details that must be included in the self appraisal document. This is generic
        guidance, but can easily be adapted to employees of any level or role.
    </p>

<section aria-labelledby="business-impact">
    <h2 id="business-impact">Business Impact</h2>
    <p>
        Instead of just listing features that you worked on, you have to shift the narrative to what the business
        impact of your work was. Don't just record your activities, but also record how your contributions affected
        user behavior, product adoption or business metrics. Try to assign a quantifiable value to the impact in terms
        of revenue, cost savings, user satisfaction, product performance, or any other metric that is relevant to your
        business.
    </p>
    <div class="callout-box">
        <div class="callout-box-title">Example</div>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Weak:</strong> "I significantly improved the performance of the landing page."</li>
            <li><strong>Strong:</strong> "Reduced landing page latency by 30%, resulting in a 2% increase in conversion
                rate."</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
        If you are looking to add structure to this section, you can adopt the <strong>STAR</strong> (Situation, Task,
        Action, Result) or <strong>Google's XYZ formula</strong>.
    </p>
</section>

<section aria-labelledby="knowledge-sharing">
    <h2 id="knowledge-sharing">Knowledge Sharing</h2>
    <p>
        You are expected to share your knowledge with your team members and stakeholders. This can be in the form of
        documentation, mentoring, or technical guidance.
        This contributes to the overall productivity and capability of your team in the long term.
        A lot of times this can be invisible, but you have to explicitly call out all the instances where you shared
        your knowledge and how it helped the team.
        This helps in building the likelihood of you being viewed as a domain or product or a technical expert, which
        will lead to more higher-value opportunities.
    </p>
</section>

<section aria-labelledby="collaboration-success">
    <h2 id="collaboration-success">Collaboration Success</h2>
    <p>
        At any level in your organization or in any role, you will be expected to collaborate with your team members
        and stakeholders in other teams and external organizations.
        This can be in the form of technical discussions, projects with shared goals, exploration of greenfield
        opportunities, or resolving client issues which need contributions from multiple teams or direct interfacing
        with clients or their representatives.
    </p>
    <p>
        You should write about the decisions you influenced, the risks you reduced, how you helped accelerate the
        timelines, and resolved the conflicts. In summary, you should write about your impact on the collaboration and
        not just participation.
        Call out the people, teams and organizations that you collaborated with and the success it led to.
    </p>

<section aria-labelledby="promotion">
    <h2 id="promotion">Promotion</h2>
    <p>
        If you are working towards a promotion in the short term, you will have to state the job responsibilities of
        the next level that you successfully executed. Your management is going to promote you only when you are
        consistently demonstrating the job responsibilities of the next level.
        This means that you are aware of such responsibilities and consciously taking them up and successfully executing
        them to demonstrate your readiness for the next level. Another factor that is not in our control for the
        promotion is the need for another person at the next level, which also needs to be considered. At the same time,
        you can tilt the situation in your favour by asserting that you would be filling that business need, rather than
        just waiting for it to happen.
    </p>

<section aria-labelledby="trainings-corporate">
    <h2 id="trainings-corporate">Trainings and Corporate Expectations</h2>
    <p>
        There are always a number of trainings and corporate expectations that you need to complete every year. This is
        more of a checklist where you need to state that you completed all of them. This will demonstrate your
        timeliness and diligence in performing these tasks on a regular basis.
    </p>
</section>

<section aria-labelledby="goals-alignment">
    <h2 id="goals-alignment">Goals and Alignment</h2>
    <p>
        At the beginning of the year, you should ensure that you are having a discussion with your management to gain a
        clear understanding of the goals and expectations for the year for your role and level.
        At frequent junctures, maybe once a quarter, you must discuss with your management whether you are aligned and
        on track to achieve the goals. You must also check if your work is closely aligned with the roadmap of your
        product and organization.
    </p>
    <p>
        During these check-ins, you must talk about what you need to operate at the top of your abilities and skills to
        successfully execute the goals. It also helps to maintain a brag document so that you don't forget these details
        by the time of the performance review.
    </p>

    <div class="callout-box">
        <div class="callout-box-title">What is a Brag Document?</div>
        <p>
            A brag document is a running log where you record your accomplishments, impact, and praise in real-time
            throughout the year. This makes it much easier to write your self-appraisal when the time comes.
        </p>
    </div>
</section>

<section aria-labelledby="growth-opportunities">
    <h2 id="growth-opportunities">Growth Opportunities</h2>
    <p>
        A truly great self-appraisal isn't just a brag sheet. It is also an opportunity to reflect on your areas for
        growth and improvement. You can write the areas where you fell short and the steps you are taking to improve
        them. You can include them into your goals and future trainings to make the self-improvement action oriented.
        This builds immense trust with your manager and shows high self-awareness.
    </p>

<section aria-labelledby="communication">
    <h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>
    <p>
        Use direct and concise language to write your self appraisal. Again, avoid using adjectives or adverbs that do
        not provide a clear measure of your performance. Keep the content short and use quantitative values to highlight
        your accomplishments.
        You do not have to create a long laundry list of your activities, instead focus on the ones which had the
        highest visible impact across your team and organization.
    </p>
    <p>
        Use this as an opportunity to highlight any hidden or invisible contributions that have directly contributed to
        the success of your product and organization.
        A single metric is more persuasive than a paragraph of adjectives. Let the data do the talking. Keep the content
        grounded to reality and do not overstate your accomplishments using language that is not backed by data or
        metrics.
    </p>
    <div class="callout-box">
        <div class="callout-box-title">Tip</div>
        <p>
            Instead of "I was responsible for..." or "I helped with...", use powerful action verbs like Spearheaded,
            Optimized, Orchestrated, or Automated when they accurately reflect your role.
        </p>
    </div>
</section>

<section aria-labelledby="summary">
    <p style="margin-top: 40px; font-style: italic; color: var(--color-text-muted);">
        Invest time in your self appraisal document and do not rush it as a last minute administrative task. Consider it
        as a prominent tool that helps in your career growth. Ensure that it is comprehensive, accurate and impactful.
        Take a proactive approach on your goals at the beginning of the year and consistently work towards them through
        the year. Let the self appraisal document serve as a scorecard at the end of the year to reflect on your
        achievements and areas for improvement. Writing a strong self appraisal document is the most effective way to
        own your career narrative.
        <br><br>
        Your self-appraisal is not just a document for your manager—it's a reflection of your professional journey and a
        roadmap for your future growth.
