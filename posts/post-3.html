<p>We often reflect on our actions that didn’t go well and try to identify the reasons behind those negative outcomes.
    We analyze why the action failed. That’s outcome mindset.</p>

<p>We gain much more if we analyze the process by which we made the decision to choose that action in the first place.
    That’s system mindset.</p>

<p>The same applies for organizations when we analyze projects and strategies when they fail. If we rely on the outcome
    mindset, we land on predictable reasons like we should have worked harder. Such conclusions may not help us make
    real improvements.</p>

<p>If we adopt a system mindset, we would be examining the quality of our decisions, not just the quality of our
    outcomes. This will help us lead to a much better thinking process and more effective action items, thereby
    increasing the chances of our success.</p>

<p>The essence is that we must adopt the system mindset to understand our failures and successes. We need to keep asking
    why the organization made the choices it did and how the decision making process can be improved. We need to help
    teams adopt the system mindset to strengthen their decisions and outcomes.</p>

<p>This mindset applies to individuals too. It helps us improve how we make decisions and learn more from our mistakes.
